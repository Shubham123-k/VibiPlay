A modern browser-based music streaming player inspired by Spotify UI — built completely using **HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript**.

VibiPlay dynamically loads albums & songs from folders and allows users to play music with real-time controls, seekbar tracking and volume management — all without any backend.
